Command Syntax:
<command-name> -<parameter1> -<parameter2> -<parameter3>
(Note)  A parameter may or may not be required.  If the parameter is a positional parameter (assigned a position in syntax structure), the argument can be used without the parameter.  (we will discuss this more in detail later)
ï»¿
(Note2)  PowerShell is case-insensitive.  This means that Command-Name and command-name both perform the same action.  This includes parameters, variables and aliases.
